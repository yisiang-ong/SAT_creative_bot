1: random decide,2: prioritise necessity,3: experiment your peak energy period
"When purchasing multiple necessity items such as clothes and toothbrushes, try to buy the same style. Then, for one day, when you decide on trivial activities such as dressing up, randomly choose it and wear it without spending too much effort. ","List down the activities you would do in a week, and categorise them as a necessity (daily activities, career job, creative domain) and pleasure (sex, watching a Netflix series, etc.). Start planning your necessity column, integrate it into your daily schedule, and reduce or ignore the activities you seek as pleasure.","Try working out which time of the day your energy quality is at its highest and how long it lasts by experimenting with it in a few days. After figuring out your pattern, try pursuing the activities in your creative domain within that time to maximise your creative potential."
